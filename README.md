In this assignment from The Odin Project I was tasked with creating a simple website using only HTML. The website focused on recipes for dishes I enjoy. I made an index file and used anchors to link it to three additional html files that each covered specific recipes. In doing so I learned more about linking webpages with the <a> element. For the three additional pages, I used <img> to showcase the respective food and then used <h1> <h2> <h3> headers to break this page up into a more reader friendly format. I used both <ul> and <ol> (unordered lists and ordered lists) To clearly write out both the ingredients and steps required to make each dish. This was a fun way to use everything I learned so far and also get some experience using Git and Github. I'm not sure if I was too exact and made too many commits, so I would like to ask for some guidance in this area.  # odin-recipes
