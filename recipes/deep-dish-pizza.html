        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deep dish pizza is a thick, pan-baked style built with a tall, buttery crust that holds substantial layers.
           Cheese goes in first, followed by a generous blanket of chunky tomato sauce, creating a dense, structured 
           slice that’s eaten more like a hearty meal than a quick bite.</p>
