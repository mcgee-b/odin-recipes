        <h1>Deep Dish Pizza</h1>

        <img src="img/pizza.jpg" alt="A delicious deep dish pizza">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deep dish pizza is a thick, pan-baked style built with a tall, buttery crust that holds substantial layers.
           Cheese goes in first, followed by a generous blanket of chunky tomato sauce, creating a dense, structured 
           slice that’s eaten more like a hearty meal than a quick bite.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup yellow cornmeal</li>

            <li>1¼ cups warm water</li>
            <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>⅓ cup melted butter</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3–4 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
            <li>½–1 pound Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Any additional toppings you want</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1–2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2–3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan for finishing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Prepare the dough:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit until foamy, about 5–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast mixture, olive oil, and melted butter.</li>
            <li>Mix until a rough dough forms, then knead for 5–7 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Prepare the sauce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 15–20 minutes until slightly thickened. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Prep the toppings:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Italian sausage, if using, breaking it into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Slice or prepare any additional toppings.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the crust:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a deep dish pan or a cast-iron skillet.</li>
            <li>Press the dough into the pan, pushing it up the sides to form a tall crust.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assemble:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the cheese first, covering the bottom completely.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked sausage and any other toppings.</li>
            <li>Spoon the sauce over the top in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with parmesan.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bake:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bake for 25–30 minutes until the crust is golden and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza rest for 10 minutes before slicing so it holds its shape.</li>
        </ol>
