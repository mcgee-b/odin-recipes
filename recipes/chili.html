        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chili con carne is a hearty stew built around tender beef simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic,
           and a blend of warm spices like cumin and chili powder. Beans are sometimes added depending on the regional style,
           but the core is the slow-cooked mix of meat and spices that develops a deep, rich flavor. The result is a thick,
           comforting dish that balances heat, savoriness, and a little acidity, perfect on its own or served over rice,
           potatoes, or cornbread.</p>
