        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yellow split pea soup is a thick, comforting dish made by simmering dried split peas with onions, carrots,
           celery, and broth until everything breaks down into a smooth, hearty base. It develops a deep, earthy flavor
           as the peas soften, and often gets an extra savory boost from smoked meat like ham or bacon, though it’s 
           just as good made vegetarian. The final result is a warm, filling soup with a velvety texture and simple,
           nostalgic flavor.
