        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yellow split pea soup is a thick, comforting dish made by simmering dried split peas with onions, carrots,
           celery, and broth until everything breaks down into a smooth, hearty base. It develops a deep, earthy flavor
           as the peas soften, and often gets an extra savory boost from smoked meat like ham or bacon, though it’s 
           just as good made vegetarian. The final result is a warm, filling soup with a velvety texture and simple,
           nostalgic flavor.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Base</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1–2 tablespoons oil or butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2–3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Peas & liquid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups (about 300 g) yellow split peas, rinsed</li>
            <li>4–5 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Seasoning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional but great</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small smoked ham hock, smoked bacon, or smoked sausage</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>A splash of cream at the end if you want it richer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Prep your ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Dice the carrots and celery.</li>
            <li>Rinse the yellow split peas under cold water until the water runs mostly clear.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Start the base</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1–2 tbsp oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften and the onion turns translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute, so it becomes fragrant but doesn’t brown.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Add peas and seasonings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the rinsed yellow split peas to the pot and stir to coat them in the oil and veg.</li>
            <li>Add:
                <ul>
                    <li>4–5 cups broth (start with 4; add more later if needed)</li>
                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                    <li>Optional: smoked paprika for extra depth</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you’re using ham hock / bacon / smoked sausage, add it now.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bring to a simmer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn the heat up and bring the pot to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, reduce the heat to low so it simmers quietly.</li>
            <li>Partially cover the pot with a lid.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook until peas are soft</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the soup simmer for 45–60 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>The peas should break down and become very soft.</li>
            <li>If the soup gets too thick or starts sticking, add a bit more broth or water and stir.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adjust texture</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rustic / chunky:</strong><br>Just stir vigorously with a spoon or whisk to break things up a bit.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoother:</strong><br>Use an immersion blender briefly in the pot until it reaches your preferred
            consistency. Don’t overdo it if you still want some texture.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Season to taste</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>If it’s too thick, thin with a bit more broth or hot water.</li>
            <li>If it’s too thin, simmer uncovered for a few more minutes to reduce.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
